# HR-Analysis

# OVERVIEW
I present to you my recent project , which involved uncovering key insights from a company dataset by studying Employee Demographics ,
Employee Performance & Satisfaction Ratings, & Employee Attrition.

This project is driven by the need to understand;
- Who Is Leaving?
- Why They Are Leaving? 
- How Performance And Satisfaction Vary Across The Organization?
so that the company can implement effective strategies for talent retention and development.

# Tools
- Microsoft Excel

## Who is leaving ?
- By job role : the profiles of employees with the highest attrition are
Data Scientist (62), Sales Executives (57), Software Engineers (47)

- By Age group:
18-25 years (117 attritions), 26-33 years (95 attritions).
Combined, 89% of attrition comes from employees under 34years

- By Education Level: Bachelors Degree holders (99), Masterâ€™s Degree holders(58), High school grads (44).

- By Department : Technology (133 attritions), Sales(92 attritions)
These two departments alone account for 95% of attrition.

- By Tenure : New employees(0-3 years at company ) the highest attrition group.

- By distance from home : Attrition is relatively even across each distance

## Why Are They Leaving?
- Most attrition is among younger employees (under 34) with less than 3 years at the company, this may be due to issues with onboarding experience , or career growth

- Young employees of age brackets 18-33 years have the highest performance ratings, but despite the good performance ,
 they are still the same age bracket with the highest attrition . the cause of them leaving the organization is pointing
 to non-performance related issues probably career development gaps.

- The early years show lower manager effectiveness scores. Poor management or leadership support may have impacted the employee experience ,
which must have led to the attrition of employees.

## How Do Performance & Satisfaction Vary Across The Organization ?
- By Age Group : younger employees of age bracket (18-33) consistently outperform older peers
67%+ meet expectations while Older age groups (34+) showed lower performance.
  
- Satisfaction levels have grown slowly year over year. however, a significant number of employees remain
 dissatisfied which is more observable in recent years (2021-2022)

- Manager ratings have steadily improved over time, this indicates progress across the organization.
 Although quite a significant number also need to improve and this is easily observed in recent years(2020, 2021, &2022)

# Conculsion 
- In Conclusion, this analysis show how most attrition are occurring and the various factors leading to high attritions. To address issues faced by the organization the company can focus on improving onboarding, career development, and management support particularly in high attrition roles. Strengthening these areas can boost retention, enhance employee satisfaction, and protect valuable talents.
